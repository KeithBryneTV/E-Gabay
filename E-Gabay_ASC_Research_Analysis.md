## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background of the Study

At Apayao State College, technology is becoming an important part of how we learn, communicate, and solve problems. However, when it comes to student consultations and reporting concerns, many processes are still done the old-fashioned way—through paperwork, face-to-face meetings, or informal conversations. These traditional methods can be slow, confusing, and sometimes even intimidating for students.

One of the biggest challenges is that some students feel shy or uncomfortable about approaching the guidance office or school authorities in person. This hesitation can stop them from asking for help or reporting issues, especially if the matter is sensitive or personal. As a result, some problems go unnoticed or unresolved.

To help address these concerns, we came up with the idea for *E-Gabay ASC*. This is an online system designed especially for Apayao State College, where students can easily and privately request consultations, report problems, and communicate with counselors or administrators. A key feature of *E-Gabay ASC* is its live chat functionality, which allows students not only to consult with staff in real time but also to report issues directly through the chat. By using a web-based platform, *E-Gabay ASC* aims to make it easier for everyone to connect, keep records organized, and ensure that no student is left unheard.

### 1.2 Statement of the Problem

The traditional student counseling and academic support system at Apayao State College faces several critical inefficiencies that hinder effective service delivery:

1. *Slow Communication:* Without a single platform, it takes time for students and staff to schedule consultations or report issues.

2. *Missing Records:* Paperwork can get lost or be incomplete, making it hard to keep track of what’s happening.

3. *Limited Access:* Students may not always be able to visit the guidance office, especially outside of office hours or due to personal circumstances.

4. *Shyness and Hesitation:* Some students are too shy or uncomfortable to approach the guidance office in person, so they don’t get the help they need.

5. *Extra Work for Staff:* Managing all the paperwork and schedules by hand takes up a lot of time for school staff.

6. *Lack of Real-Time Reporting:* There is no convenient way for students to report issues instantly while consulting with staff, which can delay the resolution of urgent concerns.

This study aims to address these problems by developing and implementing the E-Gabay ASC digital support system that enhances accessibility, improves documentation, facilitates secure communication, ensures privacy, and optimizes resource management.

### 1.3 Objectives of the Study

**General Objective:**
To develop and implement a comprehensive digital support system (E-Gabay ASC) that enhances student welfare service delivery through improved accessibility, communication, and resource management at Apayao State College.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. To design and develop an integrated web-based platform that facilitates online consultation requests, appointment scheduling, and case management for student welfare services.

2. To implement a secure real-time communication system with chat functionality and file sharing capabilities to enable effective counselor-student interactions.

3. To create a comprehensive user management system with role-based access controls for students, counselors, and administrators to ensure appropriate service delivery and data security.

4. To develop an automated notification and reminder system that improves service engagement and reduces missed appointments through email and in-system alerts.

5. To integrate robust security features including user authentication, session management, and data encryption to protect sensitive student information and ensure GDPR compliance.

6. To establish a reporting and analytics module that enables administrators to monitor service utilization, track outcomes, and make data-driven decisions for service improvement.

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations
